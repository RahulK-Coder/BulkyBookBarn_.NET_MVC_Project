In this .NET MVC project, I developed a web application that performed full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. The application was designed to manage and maintain Category and Product inventory efficiently. I implemented features that allowed users to create new product entries, retrieve detailed product information, update existing records, and delete obsolete entries. The project will be upgraded to include data validation, user authentication, and role-based access control, ensuring secure and reliable operations..This experience enhanced my skills in .NET MVC, Entity Framework, and SQL Server, and provided valuable hands-on experience in building robust and scalable web applications.
